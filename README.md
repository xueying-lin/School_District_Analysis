# Overview of the school district analysis
This analysis is to help Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, to prepare the analysis report of school performance based on student funding and students' standardized test scores of math and reading.

Due to the evidence of academic dishonesty, Maria needs to re-analyze the data by replacing the math and reading scores of ninth-grade student from Thomas High School with NaNs, to see how the results would be changed.

  - Purpose: Remove the false data and keep the analysis correct. This analysis report is to show the trends of school performance based on funding, grade, school size, and type to assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities.
